    ## Overview
    Use this API to access a patient’s immunisation history.

    You can:
    - get a patient's coronavirus (COVID-19) immunisation history, based on their NHS number

    You cannot currently use this API to:
    - get details of other types of immunisation

    You get the following data:
    - immunisation event details
    - patient demographic details, as captured at the point of immunisation

    The patient demographic details might differ from those held in the [Personal Demographics Service (PDS)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/demographics).
    To get demographic details from PDS, use the [Personal Demographics Service FHIR API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/personal-demographics-service-fhir).

    ### Data availability, timing and quality
    All immunisation records are verified to ensure the NHS number is correct before making them available via the API.

    In most cases this is automatic, and the record is available within 48 hours of the immunisation event, sometimes sooner.

    Where automated NHS number verification fails, we verify the NHS number manually, which can take longer.

    In a very small number of cases, we are unable to verify the NHS number, and we do not make the immunisation record available at all.

    ## Who can use this API
    This API:
    - is only for use by patient-facing applications
    - is only for non-clinical use
    - can only be used where there is a legal basis to do so

    Make sure you have a valid use case before you go too far with your development.
    To do this, [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).

    You must do this before you can go live (see ‘Onboarding’ below).

    ## API status and roadmap
    This API is [in production](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses).

    To see our roadmap, or to suggest, comment or vote on features for this API, see our [interactive product backlog](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/?tag=immunisation-history-api).

    If you have any other queries, [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).

    ## Service level

    This API is a platinum service, meaning it is operational and supported 24 x 7 x 365.

    For more details, see [service levels](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#service-levels).

    ## Technology
    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#basic-rest).

    It conforms to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#fhir) global standard for health care data exchange, specifically to [FHIR R4 (v4.0.1)](https://hl7.org/fhir/r4/), except that it does not support the [capabilities](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#capabilities) interaction.

    It includes some country-specific FHIR extensions, which conform to [FHIR UK Core](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core), specifically [fhir.r4.ukcore.stu1 0.5.1](https://simplifier.net/packages/fhir.r4.ukcore.stu1/0.5.1).
    
    You do not need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules.
    In particular:
    - resource names are capitalised and singular, and use US spellings, for example `/Immunization` not `/immunisations`
    - array names are singular, for example `entry` not `entries` for address lines
    - data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an `extension` object

    There are [libraries and SDKs available](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir-libraries-and-sdks) to help with FHIR API integration.

    ## Network access
    This API is available on the internet and, indirectly, on the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network).

    For more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).

    ## Security and authorisation

    This API has two access modes: 
    * application-restricted access
    * user-restricted access

    ### Application-restricted access
    
    This access mode is [application-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#application-restricted-apis), meaning we authenticate the calling application but not the end user.
    
    To use this access mode, use the following security pattern:
    * [Application-restricted RESTful API - signed JWT authentication](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/application-restricted-restful-apis-signed-jwt-authentication)
    
    ### User-restricted access

    Use this [user-restricted access mode](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis) if the end user is a patient:
    * the end user must have their identity verified to 'high' (P9) level
    * the NHS number in the request must match the NHS number in the NHS login account
    
    To use this access mode, use the following security pattern:
    * [User-restricted RESTful APIs - NHS login separate authentication and authorisation](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/user-restricted-restful-apis-nhs-login-separate-authentication-and-authorisation)

    ### Sandbox testing
    Our [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing):
    * is for early developer testing
    * only covers a limited set of scenarios
    * is open access, so does not allow you to test authorisation

    For details of sandbox test scenarios, or to try out the sandbox using our 'Try this API' feature, see the documentation for each endpoint.

    Alternatively, you can try out the sandbox using our Postman collection:

    [![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/b7dfde415e5726658d09)

    ### Integration testing
    Our [integration test environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing):
    * is for formal integration testing
    * includes authorisation

    It also includes ready-to-use [immunisation history test data](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/immunisation-history-fhir/immunisation-history-fhir-api-test-data).

    For more details see [integration testing with our RESTful APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing-with-our-restful-apis).

    ## Onboarding
    You need to get your software approved by us before it can go live with this API. We call this onboarding. The onboarding process can sometimes be quite long, so it’s worth planning well ahead.

    This API uses our online digital onboarding process. 
    
    As part of this process, you need to demonstrate that you can manage risks and that your software conforms technically with the requirements for this API. 
    
    Information on this page might impact the design of your software. For details, see [Onboarding support information](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/immunisation-history-fhir/onboarding-support-information). 
    
    To get started, see [digital onboarding](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/digital-onboarding#using-the-digital-onboarding-portal).
