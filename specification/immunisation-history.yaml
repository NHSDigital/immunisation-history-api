    ## Overview
    Use this API to access a citizen’s (COVID-19) immunisation event history.
    You can:
    - get a patient's coronavirus (COVID-19) immunisation event history, based on their NHS number
    You cannot currently use this API to:
    - get details of other types of immunisation event
    - get the vacination history for a specific date range
    You get the following data:
    - immunisation event details
    - patient demographic details, as captured at the point of the last immunisation event
    The patient demographic details might differ from those held in the [Personal Demographics Service (PDS)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/demographics).
    To get demographic details from PDS, use the [Personal Demographics Service FHIR API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/personal-demographics-service-fhir).
   
    ### Data availability, timing and quality
    All immunisation records are verified to ensure the NHS number is correct before making them available via the API.
   
    In most cases this is automatic, and the record is available within 48 hours of the immunisation event, sometimes sooner.
   
    Where automated NHS number verification fails, we verify the NHS number manually, which can take longer.
   
    In a very small number of cases, we are unable to verify the NHS number, and we do not make the immunisation record available at all.
    ## Who can use this API
    This API:
    - is only for use by patient/citizen-facing applications
    - is only for non-clinical use
    - can only be used where there is a legal basis to do so
   
    Make sure you have a valid use case before you go too far with your development.
    To do this, [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).
    You must do this before you can go live (see ‘Onboarding’ below).
    At this time, the Vaccinations API is at an early development stage and not ready to be consumed by the wider market.
 
    ## API status and roadmap   
    
    ### Status
    This API is in private beta, meaning:
    - it is available for testing but not yet for production use for developers not part of the private beta
    - it is available to a small number of developers for production use in order to gain user feedback
    - we might make breaking changes
   
    If you would like to be involved in our public beta programme, [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).
   
    ### Roadmap
    To see our roadmap, or to suggest, comment or vote on features for this API, see our [interactive product backlog](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/?tag=immunisation-history-api).
    If you have any other queries, please [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).
   
    ## Technology
    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#basic-rest).
    It also conforms to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir) global standard for health care data exchange.
    Specifically, it is aligned with [FHIR UK Core](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core), which is built on FHIR Release 4.
    You don’t need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules.
    In particular:
    - resource names are capitalised and singular, and use US spellings, for example `/Immunization` not `/immunisations`
    - array names are singular, for example `entry` not `entries` for address lines
    - data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an `extension` object
    There are [libraries and SDKs available](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir-libraries-and-sdks) to help with FHIR API integration.
   
    ## Network access
    This API is available on the internet and, indirectly, on the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network).
    For more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).
   
    ## Security and authorisation
<<<<<<< HEAD
    This API is [user-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis),
    meaning an end user must be present and authenticated.

    Specifically, it uses the following security pattern:
    - [User-restricted RESTful APIs - NHS login separate authentication and authorisation](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/user-restricted-restful-apis-nhs-login-separate-authentication-and-authorisation)

    Note that:
    - the end user must be a citizen
    - the calling application must strongly authenticate the end user using NHS login
    - the end user must have their identity verified to 'high' (P9) level
    - the NHS number in the request must match the NHS number in the NHS login account

=======
    This API is [application-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#application-restricted-apis),
    meaning we authenticate the calling application but not the end user.
   
    Specifically, it uses the following security pattern:
    - [Application-restricted RESTful API - signed JWT authentication](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/application-restricted-restful-apis-signed-jwt-authentication)
    Note that:
    - the end user must be a citizen
    - the calling application must strongly authenticate the end user using NHS login
    - specifically, the end user must have their identity verified to 'high' (P9) level
    - the calling application must pass the user's NHS login identity token in the `NHSD-User-Identity` header when calling the API
    - the NHS number in the identity token must match the NHS number for which data is being requested

    | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Sandbox           | `https://sandbox.api.service.nhs.uk/immunisation-history/FHIR/R4/`     |
    | Integration test  | `https://int.api.service.nhs.uk/immunisation-history/FHIR/R4/`         |
    | Production        | Not yet available                                                      |
    ### Sandbox testing
    Our [sandbox environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#sandbox-testing):
    * is for early developer testing
    * only covers a limited set of scenarios
    * is open access, so does not allow you to test authorisation
    For details of sandbox test scenarios, or to try out the sandbox using our 'Try this API' feature, see the documentation for each endpoint.
    Alternatively, you can try out the sandbox using our Postman collection:
   
    [![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/e999c0aeddefe51b6b89)
   
    ### Integration testing
    Our [integration test environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing):
    * is for formal integration testing
    * includes authorisation
        
    Currently, the integration test environment returns a single static response, the same one as the sandbox environment - regardless of what request parameters you send.
    In due course we will change it to support more scenarios.
    For more details see [integration testing with our RESTful APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing-with-our-restful-apis).
   
    ## Onboarding
    You need to get your software approved by us before it can go live with this API. We call this onboarding. The onboarding process can sometimes be quite long, so it’s worth planning well ahead.
    Details to follow.
